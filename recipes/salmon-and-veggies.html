    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is more of a blueprint on how to make a dinner with fish as the protein with some vegetables & grains.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fish</strong> (Salmon, Trout, something with <strong>skin on</strong>)</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables</strong> (Carrots, Broccoli/Broccolini, Onions, Garlic, whatever you like)</li>
        <li><strong>Grain</strong> (Couscous, Barley, Rice, Rice Pilaf, or just leave out and replace with a salad or
            more veggies)</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong> to taste (a few four finger pinches)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start cooking your grains as they'll take the longest or be fine to sit warm</li>
        <li>Chop vegetables into whatever shape makes sense to you</li>
        <li>Remove any bones if there are any, then salt the skin side of the fish</li>
        <li>Grab your pan and heat it up on medium (I use non-stick for fish) then add oil when hot enough</li>
        <li>Put your fish skin side down in the oil. It should sizzle. If it doesn't, take it out and wait. Once it's
            sizzling, season the face-up side with salt</li>
        <li>Start cooking your vegetables however you know how. I usually saute or steam mine, but you could oven roast
            them too</li>
        <li>Cook the fish skin side down until the flesh changes opacity and color up about halfway to 2/3 up the fish.
        </li>
        <li>Flip the fish and cook until the sides look completely cooked through and opacity changes. If the fish shape
            allows, you can cook the sides too for a little extra sear</li>
        <li>Whenever the vegetables are done (could happen earlier) set those aside</li>
        <li>Plate the dish</li>
    </ol>
