    <h1>Chicken Braise</h1>
    <img src="../images/chicken-braise.jpg" alt="Picture of plated braised chicken with carrots, onions, beets, spinach and rice pilaf" height="310" width="326">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is more of a blueprint on how to make a braise with Chicken as the protein and substitutable vegetables</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken (bone-in)</strong> (Bone-in skin-on thighs are what I always use because they are forgiving. Legs Wings probably good too, just would avoid breast)</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables</strong> (Onions, Root Vegetables, and Garlic works for me. I often do Carrots + Onions + Potatoes/Beets + Cabbage, but you could just as easily do apples + sweet potatoes or anything else)</li>
        <li><strong>Grain</strong> (Couscous, Barley, Rice, Rice Pilaf, or omit)</li>
        <li><strong>Stock</strong> (Chicken, Beef, Vegetable, or even a bunch of alcohol)</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong> to taste (a few four finger pinches)</li>
        <li><strong>Acid</strong> (Lemon, Apple Cider Vinegar, Wine, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Herbs/Seasoning</strong> (Often I do Sage, Thyme, Rosemary + Paprika on the chicken, sometimes I do Cumin, Coriander, chili powder/chipotles. Really versatile here whatever works with the vegetables)</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish</strong> (Parsley almost universally works here, so do chives and green onions or more of whatever herbs you use)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with salt all over while you heat up your Dutch oven (5-7 qt) or large saute pan (3-4 qt)</li>
        <li>Chop vegetables into whatever shape makes sense to you. They'll need to survive 30 minutes at 375 later</li>
        <li>Set oven to Bake at 375 Farenheit</li>
        <li>Set your grain cooking however it is meant to be cooked</li>
        <li>Heat up cooking surface then add oil, and add chicken skin side down. It should sizzle, if not, remove and wait until it sizzles</li>
        <li>Season the other side of the chicken with salt. When the skin releases from the pan and is golden brown, flip the chicken.</li>
        <li>When that side releases from the pan and looks slightly browned and a good fond has developed, remove the chicken and put aside on a plate</li>
        <li>Add onions and garlic (and any aromatics that benefit from hot oil blooming) if you got it at this stage and cook in chicken fat/oil/fond until fond gets too dark for comfort. Deglaze with your acid or just some water</li>
        <li>Add the rest of your vegetables and seasonings that can still handle a bit of high heat</li>
        <li>Cook for maybe 5 minutes no more, then add stock until top of vegetables are slightly uncovered</li>
        <li>Nestle the chicken atop the vegetables with the skin-side up so that it's kind of half in the liquid but the skin is not touching liquid at all. Add paprika to skin if you got it</li>
        <li>Put pan/dutch oven in the oven for ~30 minutes or until chicken thighs register a safe temperature (165+ but thighs are forgiving if you overcook b/c collagen breaks down)</li>
        <li>Plate with some grain as the bed or on the side, then Ladle some braisy-soupy vegetables on top or next to your grain</li>
        <li>Put a chicken on the plate where it feels right and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
