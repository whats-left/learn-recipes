<h1>Japanese Curry</h1>
<img src="../images/pexels-jazheel-inocencio-945922318-20127885.jpg" alt="Japanese Curry Image" height="310" width="413">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This dish is a simple, easy-to-make Japanese homestyle meal that you
    can easily make in under an hour. It's a Japanese dish inspired by a British dish inspired by an Indian dish, so it
    has elements of all three food cultures (though I wouldn't give the British too much credit).</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Roux Cubes</strong> (my favorite is Golden Curry) or follow another recipe to make from scratch</li>
    <li><strong>Meat/Protein</strong>(Chicken, Beef, Pork, or Tofu works well. Make 'em into whatever shape you like --
        cubes are good, you can make panko breaded strips for katsu style if you like)</li>
    <li><strong>Vegetables</strong> (Potatoes, Onions, Peas, Carrots, Okra, really whatever you want that can handle
        being in a stew)</li>
    <li><strong>Garnish</strong>> (green onions, chives, parsley, whatever you like)</li>
    <li><strong>Seasoning</strong> (Furikake, sesame seeds, or whatever you like)</li>
    <li><strong>Rice</strong> (Whatever your preferred kind)</li>
    <li><em>Optional: Pickled/fermented side like pickled ginger</em></li>
    <li><em>Optional: Thinly shaved cabbage salad or simmered vegetables side dish</em></li>
    <li><em>Optional: Miso soup</em></li>
    <li><em>For more about the Optional things, look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichij%C5%AB-sansai"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ichijū-sansai</a></em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Start cooking the rice in a rice cooker, or follow instructions on the bag for stovetop</li>
    <li>Cook the curry according to instructions on the box</li>
    <li>Add tougher vegetables earlier (root vegetables early, things like mushrooms/cauliflower near the middle,
        peas/leafy greens near the end)</li>
    <li>Add ladle scoops of curry on top of a scoop of rice</li>
    <li>Chop up some garnish (green onions, chives, parsley) and sprinkle over top</li>
    <li>Serve with Miso Soup and pickled ginger </li>
</ol>
